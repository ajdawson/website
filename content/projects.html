<h1>Open Source Projects</h1>
<hr/>

<p>I've written and contributed to a number of open source projects, most of which are data analysis or scientific computing projects.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<h2><a href=http://scitools.org.uk/">iris and cartopy</a></h2>
<p>I am a core developer on both these projects. The iris package is a powerful and easy to use Python library for analysing and visualising meteorological and oceanographic data sets. Cartopy is a Python library for cartographic transforms and plotting. Both are community-driven projects, led by the UK Met Office.</p>


<h2><a href="https://github.com/ajdawson/eofs">eofs</a></h2>
<p>eofs is a Python package for EOF analysis of spatial-temporal data sets.
I designed it to be suitable for use on large data sets typical of modern climate
model output. It is able to handle missing values transparently, and supports fields
with metadata. The package is also bundled with the
<a href="http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/">UV-CDAT</a> distribution.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/ajdawson/windspharm">windspharm</a></h2>
<p>windspharm is a Python package I created for doing computations on global vector
fields in spherical geometry. It provides a high level interface for computations
involving spherical harmonic transformations, and supports fields with metadata.
The package is also bundled with the <a href="http://uv-cdat.llnl.gov/">UV-CDAT</a> distribution.

<h2>Other Packages</h2>

<p>I have open-sourced a lot of my other code, see my <a href="http://github.com/ajdawson">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ajdawson">BitBucket</a> profiles for details. I have also made numerous contributions to other open-source projects such as
<a href="http://matplotlib.org">matplotlib</a>,
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyspharm/">pyspharm</a> and
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap">basemap</a>.</p>
