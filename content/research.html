<h3>Inexact processing for weather and climate prediction</h3>
<p>I'm working with Peter Dueben and others on the topic of inexact computation in numerical simulations. There are several motivations for this topic, including mitigating the increased power demands of conventional supercomputing hardware, and the representation of model uncertainty. The basic idea is that the uncertainty in a lot of the calculations we do (e.g. in model physics schemes) is probably quite large considering the floating-point precision used to compute them. We may be able to exploit new hardware architectures with lower power consumption in order to be able to improve model performance.</p>

<h3>EC-Earth (various)</h3>
<p>I'm involved in several projects that are making use of the <a href="http://www.ec-earth.org/">EC-Earth</a> model. My involvement is mostly on the technical level, making sure that the model is working on required platforms and can be deployed in the required configurations effectively.</p>

<h3>Simulating weather regimes</h3>
<p>I was a post-doc on the NERC Testing and Evaluating Model Predictions of European Storms (<a href="http://tempest.nerc.ac.uk/">TEMPEST</a>) project which was part of NERC's broader Storm Risk Mitigation programme. My contribution to the project was to try and understand the influence of small scale processes, on scales that are often left out of climate models, on larger scale phenomena. This work was focussed around the influence of resolution on the ability of a model to represent circulation regimes such as blocking and the North Atlantic oscillation.</p>
<p>The main results of the project are summarized in two papers, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012GL053284">Dawson <em>et al.</em> (2012)</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2238-x">Dawson and Palmer (2015)</a>.</p>

<h3>Tropical-extratropical interactions in high resolution climate models</h3>
<p>My PhD research was on the representation of tropical-extratropical interactions in the Pacific ocean. The tropical and extratropical Pacific ocean are remotely connected through a mechanism known as the atmospheric bridge, whereby the tropical ocean influences atmospheric circulation which then feeds back on to the ocean at higher latitudes.</p>
<p>The main result was that the mean-state of a climate model is actually critical in determining its ability to simulate complex inter-seasonal variability. This implies that if you get the mean state wrong in your climate model, you might not just get the same variability on-top-of a slightly different average, but may in fact produce a different kind of variability.</p>
<p>Some of this work is published in peer-reviewed literature: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-010-0854-7">Dawson <em>et al.</em> (2011)</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-012-1518-6">Dawson <em>et al.</em> (2013)</a>. My PhD thesis is also available <a href="https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/33037">online</a>.
