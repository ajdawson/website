<h2>Background</h2>
<hr/>

<p>My background is in meteorology and physical oceanography, in particular numerical modelling of the atmosphere and ocean. I obtained an undergraduate degree in Meteorology and Oceanography from the University of East Anglia, within the School of Environmental Sciences. I followed this up by completing a PhD in the School of Mathematics at the University of East Anglia, supervised by <a href="http://envam1.env.uea.ac.uk/">Adrian Matthews</a> and <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/~dps/">David Stevens</a>, studying coupled ocean-atmopshere interactions in global climate models.</p>

<p>I then spent 3 years working as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, working on a project that used high resolution atmospheric NWP models as climate models to understand the impact of processes that are too small to represent in typical climate models on large scale weather and climate variability.</p>

<p>I've also spent some time working in industry, both developing and deploying numerical models for operational weather and ocean wave forecasting, and developing the infrastructure to support operational forecasting services.</p>

<p>Currently I'm back working at the University of Oxford, once again on atmospheric and climate modelling, but this time with more of a focus on computational aspects of the <a href="http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/predictability-of-weather-and-climate">group's</a> research projects.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<hr/>

<p>As well as being interested in numerical modelling for weather and climate prediction, I have a strong interest in scientific computing, in particular high performance computing for numerical modelling applications, and the tools and technologies that enable science to be done in ever more efficient and useful ways.</p>

<p>I'm also interested in the development of open source data analysis tools for scientists. I believe that having freely available software written for non-proprietary programming languages enables a greater degree of sharing and collaboration in the scientific community and boosts the integrity of the science by encouraging reproducibility. The software section of this site contains details of some of the projects in this area.</p>
